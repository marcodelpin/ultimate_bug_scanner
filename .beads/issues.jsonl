Otherwise it auto-provisions (or uses) the tool-cache ast-grep 0.40.1.\\n- install.sh binary fallback for ast-grep downloads a compatible version and (ideally) warns if it can’t verify compatibility.\\n- Add/adjust a regression test that simulates a bogus/old 'ast-grep' on PATH and ensures ubs selects tool-cache instead.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-17T22:41:04.752073-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-17T22:52:18.878297-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-17T22:52:18.878297-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ultimate_bug_scanner-fbq","depends_on_id":"ultimate_bug_scanner-js-ts-ast-guarantee","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-17T22:41:24.482085-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
